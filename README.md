# libft
this my very first project on 42 netwrok, through 11337 compuse on bengrire/morocco.
it is basically a library wich contains alot of functions that we will need and use on the next projects, most of them are standard functions like "strlen", it is function that calculate for us the lengh of a sring, but we are not allowed to use it, we have to code our own.
